‚Ä¢ It is your responsibility to make sure that all code and other deliverables are in the correct format and that your submission compiles and runs. We will not manually check your code (this is not feasible given the class size). Thus, non-runnable code in our test environment will directly lead to a score of 0. Also, be sure to clean up print statements, etc. before submitting ‚Äì the autograder will likely reject your entire submission and we would not be able to grant you any points.

‚Ä¶there is still little insight into the internal operation and behavior of these complex models, or how they achieve such good performance. From a scientific standpoint, this is deeply unsatisfactory. With-out clear understanding of how and why they work, the development of better models is reduced to trial-and-error.

Zeiler and Fergus. 2014

Overview

Interpretability matters. In order to build trust in intelligent systems and move towards their meaningful integration into our everyday lives, it is clear that we must build ‚Äòtransparent‚Äô models that have the ability to explain why they predict what they predict.

This assignment has two main parts. The first part explores the use of different types of saliency methods, which provide insight into the decision-making processes of image convolutional networks (CNNs). The second part involves using gradient manipulation techniques to extract the content and style from different images and combine them to produce creative works. If you are unfamiliar with these concepts, review relevant course material and the required readings for this assignment. The concepts covered will provide you with valuable tools for model analysis, including explainability, bias determinations, and debugging, which can be extended to other domains, such as text and audio.

For this assignment, we will use conda to create a Python environment with the required packages installed.

1 conda env create -f environment.yaml

2 conda activate cs7643-a3

Deliverables

To submit your code to Gradescope, you will need to upload a zipped file containing all your code with the folder structure intact. You can run collect_submission.py to automate this process. Once complete, upload assignment_3_submission.zip to Gradescope Assignment 3 Code.

Once you have completed your write-up, upload it to Gradescope Assignment 3 Written, ensuring that you assign the correct pages to the corresponding questions.4

1 Part I: Network Visual Inspections

In the first section of Part I, we will apply gradient and signal methods on top of SqueezeNet, a compact CNN model that achieves high performance on the ImageNet dataset while being significantly smaller than other models, such as VGG and ResNet. SqueezeNet has a file size of less than 5 megabytes, making it well-suited for deployment on memory-limited devices. According to the original paper, SqueezeNet achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60% and a top-5 accuracy of 80% on the ImageNet dataset.

In this section, we will implement the following techniques:

‚Ä¢ Class Model Visualizations: We will synthesize an image to maximize the classification score of a particular class to provide insights into what the network focuses on when classifying images of that class.

‚Ä¢ Class-Specific Saliency Maps for Images: We will generate image-specific saliency maps to quickly determine which parts of an image influenced the network‚Äôs classification decision for a particular class.

‚Ä¢ GradCAM: We will use Gradient Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM) to highlight the areas in an image that are most relevant to a given label.

1.1 Pre-requisite Reading

follow to solidify your understanding. Links to the papers can be found in the assignment materials or by conducting a quick search online.

‚Ä¢ Karen Simonyan, Andrea Vedaldi, and Andrew Zisserman. ‚ÄùDeep Inside Convolutional Networks: Visualising Image Classification Models and Saliency Maps‚Äù, ICLR Workshop 2014.

1.1.1 Questions

1. How does Zeiler‚Äôs deconvnets work and how are they related to Simonyan‚Äôs class visualization methods?

2. Explain how Simonyan et al. are able to produce a class model visualization starting with a zero image? How is this different than their image-specific class saliency method?

3. Why do Selvaraju et. al place such high value on the last convolutional layer? Why is GradCAM considered to be class discriminative?

1.2 Class Model Visualizations

First up are class model visualizations. This idea was first presented by Simonyan et al. and later extended by Yosinski et al. to include regularization techniques that improve the quality of the generated image.

Concretely, let I be an image and let y be a target class. Let sy(I) be the score that a convolutional network assigns to the image I for class y; note that these are raw unnormalized scores, not class probabilities. We wish to generate an image I‚àó that achieves a high score for the class y by solving the problem

I‚àó = argmaxsy(I)‚àí R(I)

I

where R is a (possibly implicit) regularizer (note the sign of R(I) in the argmax: we want to minimize this regularization term). We can solve this optimization problem using gradient ascent, computing gradients with respect to the generated image. We will use L2 regularization (squared L2 norm) of the form:

and implicit regularization as suggested by [3] by periodically blurring the generated image. We can solve this problem using gradient ascent on the generated image.

Your tasks are as follows:

1. Follow the instructions in visualizers/class_visualization.py to implement functions that manually compute class visualizations.

2. Run ./class_visualization.py and verify your plots were saved.

3 ./visualization/class_visualization.png

1.3 Saliency map

A saliency map tells us the degree to which each pixel in a given image affects the classification score for that image. To compute it, we compute the gradient of the unnormalized score corresponding to the correct class (which is a scalar) with respect to the pixels of the image. If the image has shape (3, H, W), then this gradient will also have shape (3, H, W); for each pixel in the image, this gradient tells us the amount by which the classification score will change if the pixel changes by a small amount at that pixel. To compute the saliency map, we take the absolute value of this gradient, then take the maximum value over the 3 input channels element-wise; the final saliency map thus has shape (H, W), and all entries are non-negative.

Your tasks are as follows:

1. Follow the instructions in ./saliency_visualization.py and implement functions to manually create saliency maps.

2. Run ./saliency_visualization.py and verify your plots were saved:

3 ./visualization/saliency_visualization.png

1.4 GradCAM

Gradient Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM)is a technique that highlights the regions of an image that the network uses to make a particular prediction using a heatmap overlaid on top of the source image. In this task, we will implement GradCAM to visualize the activation maps of various layers of a pre-trained convolutional neural network and examine the results to gain insights into the network‚Äôs behavior.

Your tasks are as follows:

1. Follow the instructions in ./gradcam_visualization.py and implement GradCAM.

2. Run ./gradcam_visualization.py and verify your plots were saved:

3 ./visualization/gradcam_visualization.png

2 Part II: Style Transfer

Another task closely related to image gradients is style transfer. Style transfer is a technique that allows us to apply the style of one image to the content of another, resulting in a new image that combines the two. This technique has become increasingly popular in computer vision and deep learning, as it allows us to generate blended images that combine the content of one image with the style of another. We will study and implement the style transfer technique from:

‚Ä¢ Gatys et al., ‚ÄùImage Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks‚Äù, CVPR 2015

The general idea is to take two images (a content image and a style image), and produce a new image that reflects the content of one but the artistic ‚Äùstyle‚Äù of the other. We will do this by first formulating a loss function that matches the content and style of each respective image in the feature space of a deep network, and then performing gradient descent on the pixels of the image itself.

2.1 Content Loss

We can generate an image that reflects the content of one image and the style of another by incorporating both in our loss function. We want to penalize deviations from the content of the content image and deviations from the style of the style image. We can then use this hybrid loss function to perform gradient descent not on the parameters of the model, but instead on the pixel values of our original image.

Let‚Äôs first write the content loss function. Content loss measures how much the feature map of the generated image differs from the feature map of the source image. We only care about the content representation of one layer of the network (say, layer `), that has feature maps A` ‚àà R1√óC`√óH`√óW`. C` is the number of channels in layer `, H` and W` are the height and width. We will work with reshaped versions of these feature maps that combine all spatial positions into one dimension. Let F` ‚àà RN`√óM` be the feature map for the current image and P` ‚ààRN`√óM` be the feature map for the content source image where M` = H` √ó W` is the number of elements in each feature map. Each row of F` or P` represents the vectorized activations of a particular filter, convolved over all positions of the image. Finally, let wc be the weight of the content loss term in the loss function.

Then the content loss is given by:

Lc = wc √óPi,j(Fij` ‚àí Pij` )2

1. Implement Content Loss in style_modules/content_loss.py

You can check your implementation by running the ‚ÄôTest content loss‚Äô function. The expected error should be 0.0

2.2 Style Loss

Now we can tackle the style loss. For a given layer `, the style loss is defined as follows:

First, compute the Gram matrix G which represents the correlations between the responses of each filter, where F is as above. The Gram matrix is an approximation to the covariance matrix ‚Äì we want the activation statistics of our generated image to match the activation statistics of our style image, and matching the (approximate) covariance is one way to do that. There are a variety of ways you could do this, but the Gram matrix is nice because it‚Äôs easy to compute and in practice shows good results.

Given a feature map F` of shape (1,C`,M`), the Gram matrix has shape (1,C`,C`) and its elements are given by:

G`ij = XFik` Fjk`

k

Assuming G` is the Gram matrix from the feature map of the current image, A` is the Gram Matrix from the feature map of the source style image, and w` a scalar weight term, then the style loss for the layer ` is simply the weighted Euclidean distance between the two Gram matrices:

In practice we usually compute the style loss at a set of layers L rather than just a single layer `; then the total style loss is the sum of style losses at each layer:

Ls = XL`s

`‚ààL

1. Implement Style Loss in style_modules/style_loss.py

You can check your implementation by running the ‚ÄôTest style loss‚Äô function. The expected error should be 0.0

2.3 Total Variation Loss

It turns out that it‚Äôs helpful to also encourage smoothness in the image. We can do this by adding another term to our loss that penalizes wiggles or total variation in the pixel values. This concept is widely used in many computer vision task as a regularization term.

You can compute the total variation as the sum of the squares of differences in the pixel values for all pairs of pixels that are next to each other (horizontally or vertically). Here we sum the total-variation regularization for each of the 3 input channels (RGB), and weight the total summed loss by the total variation weight, wt:

You should try to provide an efficient vectorized implementation.

1. Implement Style Loss in style_modules/tv_loss.py

You can check your implementation by running ‚ÄôTest total variation loss‚Äô function. The expected error should be 0.0

2.4 Style Transfer

You have implemented all the loss functions in the paper. Now we‚Äôre ready to string it all together. Please read the entire function: figure out what are all the parameters, inputs, solvers, etc. The update rule in function style_transfer of style_utils.py is held out for you to finish.

As the final step, run the script style_transfer.py to generate stylized images.

Include your two selected images (before) and the stylized image (after) in the report.
